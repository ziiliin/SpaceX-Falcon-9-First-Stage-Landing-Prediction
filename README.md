# SpaceX-Falcon-9-First-Stage-Landing-Prediction
A primary reason behind SpaceX's stellar success is its relatively inexpensive rocket launches, founded on its ingenious reuse of the first stage of a rocket. Thus, to estimate the cost of a launch, it is critical to predict if the first stage will land. In this project, we attempt to predict first stage landing of SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket.
